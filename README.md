This modified script is for the PortMaster version of Devilutionx.

This modified script changes the controls to be more comfortable for the RG351V. It swaps the analog sticks so that Left Analog is always used for mouse control. It also fixes the A/B/X/Y buttons because they appear to be swapped in the Portmaster version.
